A&nbsp;platform that controls communication and navigation of&nbsp;a&nbsp;large number of&nbsp;drones, which performs various real-time tasks. In&nbsp;this project, I&nbsp;made an&nbsp;HTML page layout with main dashboard manager drones and page of&nbsp;Sign Up. It&nbsp;was my&nbsp;first experience with a&nbsp;team of&nbsp; 10&nbsp;developers.
